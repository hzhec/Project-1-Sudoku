<h2>How To Play</h2>
<p> Sudoku is played on a grid of 9x9 grid. Within the rows and columns are 9 subgrids (made up of nine 3x3 "squares"). </p>
<p>Each row, column and subgrid needs to be filled out with the numbers 1 to 9, without repeating any numbers within the row, column or square</p>

<h2>Tips for Beginners</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Look for easy play first</b> - crowded row/column/subgrid that is almost full of numbers. This way you can quickly use process of elimination to figure out where to place a number.</li>
  <li><b>Look for which numbers are missing</b> - is about placing digit where they don't already exist. If a number already exists in a row/column/subgrid, then that number cannot be placed again.</li>
  <li><b>Don't (Try not to) guess</b></li>
  <li><b>Keep Moving</b> - if stuck, don't concentrate too hard on one part of the puzzle grid.</li>
  <li><b>Constantly re-evalutate</b> - Ask yourself, if you place a number in a row, how does that number affect corresponding column and subgrid.</li>
</ul>
